### QUESTION 1
Binary Tree - Find the Diameter of a Binary Tree 
Problem Statement: 
Write a program to calculate the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter of a 
binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. 
The path may or may not pass through the root. 
You are required to: 
1.  Build the binary tree using level-order input. Use -1 to represent null 
nodes. 
2.  Implement a function to calculate the diameter of the binary tree 
efficiently using recursion. 
Input Format: 
1.  The first line contains a list of integers representing the level-order 
traversal of the binary tree. Use -1 for null nodes. 
Output Format: 
Print an integer representing the diameter of the binary tree.
